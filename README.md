All simulation codes are available under "scratch" directory. To run these codes type in "./waf --run ./scratch/file_name_here". Please note that you need to run the following command only ONCE before running each experiment:
"CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O0" ./waf -d optimized configure"
Above command helps you to ignore compile warnings.
